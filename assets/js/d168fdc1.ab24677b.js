For every request, we should validate the input. Although I like zod, fastify-type-provider-zod is a 3rd party library and I had problems using it. Perhaps I just need more time to figure it out, but I decided to use @fastify/type-provider-typebox since I felt that @fastify/type-provider-json-schema-to-ts was too verbose and @fastify/type-provider-zod was not working for me. The interface is very similar to zod, so it was easy to pick up.","sidebar":"notesSidebar"},"hello":{"id":"hello","title":"Hello","description":"This is my first Docusaurus document!"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Tutorial Intro","description":"Let\'s discover Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes."},"tutorial-basics/congratulations":{"id":"tutorial-basics/congratulations","title":"Congratulations!","description":"You have just learned the basics of Docusaurus and made some changes to the initial template."},"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post","title":"Create a Blog Post","description":"Docusaurus creates a page for each blog post, but also a blog index page, a tag system, an RSS feed..."},"tutorial-basics/create-a-document":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-document","title":"Create a Document","description":"Documents are groups of pages connected through:"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-page":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-page","title":"Create a Page","description":"Add Markdown or React files to src/pages to create a standalone page:"},"tutorial-basics/deploy-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-basics/deploy-your-site","title":"Deploy your site","description":"Docusaurus is a static-site-generator (also called Jamstack)."},"tutorial-basics/markdown-features":{"id":"tutorial-basics/markdown-features","title":"Markdown Features","description":"Docusaurus supports Markdown and a few additional features."},"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions":{"id":"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions","title":"Manage Docs Versions","description":"Docusaurus can manage multiple versions of your docs."},"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site","title":"Translate your site","description":"Let\'s translate docs/intro.md to French."}}}}')}}]);
